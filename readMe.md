# Multiple Account Regal App
## When your family/friends have multiple accounts and don't want everyone to pull out their phones.

### Purpose of the App
My friends/family are going to the movies more often thanks to Movie Pass. I felt pretty bad for the employyees
having to juggle phones, Movie Pass, QR codes, regal accounts for x amount of people. This app helps accumulate all accounts
in one Phone so its easy as pie. Cake. Easy as.. Stealing Candy from no one, because that's wrong. Just install the app,
store your accounts, and quickly pull every account up you need! It's also a great way to keep track of who has a birthday, 
which Regal awards a free small popcorn! 

### Note
This is made for api > 23
Not certain how it will perform on lower apis. Since my family and friends run somewhat up to date phones, no one needed a lower api.
If there are crashes, let me know and I'll update it to work with lower apis.

### To Install 
Go to my app/release/app-release.apk Or [Click here](https://github.com/Rmacias91/popcorn/blob/master/app/release/app-release.apk)

You can also install by creating your own apk when opening the project with Android Studio.
